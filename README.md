# COMP001B.LectureActivity4
<!--
Author: Matthew Tan
Purpose: This is the fourth lecture activity with an index.html, main.css, and README.md. The purpose of this activity is to emphasize use of primary/secondary color usage in the webpage. The current color combination shown in my webpage is a darker and lighter shade of grey as a way to complement each other. The link color changes to a light green after it is visited to enhance readability. The same goes for the white color for all the text.
